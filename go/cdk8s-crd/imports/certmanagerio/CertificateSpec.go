	IssuerRef *CertificateSpecIssuerRef `field:"required" json:"issuerRef" yaml:"issuerRef"`
	// Name of the Secret resource that will be automatically created and managed by this Certificate resource.
	//
	// It will be populated with a private key and certificate, signed by the denoted issuer. The Secret resource lives in the same namespace as the Certificate resource.
	SecretName *string `field:"required" json:"secretName" yaml:"secretName"`
	// Defines extra output formats of the private key and signed certificate chain to be written to this Certificate's target Secret.

	// Requested common name X509 certificate subject attribute.
	//
	// More info: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.6 NOTE: TLS clients will ignore this value when any subject alternative name is set (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125#section-6.4.4).
	// Should have a length of 64 characters or fewer to avoid generating invalid CSRs. Cannot be set if the `literalSubject` field is set.
	CommonName *string `field:"optional" json:"commonName" yaml:"commonName"`
	// Requested DNS subject alternative names.
	DnsNames *[]*string `field:"optional" json:"dnsNames" yaml:"dnsNames"`
	// Requested 'duration' (i.e. lifetime) of the Certificate. Note that the issuer may choose to ignore the requested duration, just like any other requested attribute. If unset, this defaults to 90 days. Minimum accepted duration is 1 hour. Value must be in units accepted by Go time.ParseDuration https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration.
	Duration *string `field:"optional" json:"duration" yaml:"duration"`
	// Requested email subject alternative names.
	EmailAddresses *[]*string `field:"optional" json:"emailAddresses" yaml:"emailAddresses"`
	// Whether the KeyUsage and ExtKeyUsage extensions should be set in the encoded CSR.
	//
	// This option defaults to true, and should only be disabled if the target issuer does not support CSRs with these X509 KeyUsage/ ExtKeyUsage extensions.
	EncodeUsagesInRequest *bool `field:"optional" json:"encodeUsagesInRequest" yaml:"encodeUsagesInRequest"`
	// Requested IP address subject alternative names.
	IpAddresses *[]*string `field:"optional" json:"ipAddresses" yaml:"ipAddresses"`
	// Requested basic constraints isCA value.
	//
	// The isCA value is used to set the `isCA` field on the created CertificateRequest resources. Note that the issuer may choose to ignore the requested isCA value, just like any other requested attribute.
	// If true, this will automatically add the `cert sign` usage to the list of requested `usages`.
	IsCa *bool `field:"optional" json:"isCa" yaml:"isCa"`
	// Additional keystore output formats to be stored in the Certificate's Secret.
	Keystores *CertificateSpecKeystores `field:"optional" json:"keystores" yaml:"keystores"`
	// Requested X.509 certificate subject, represented using the LDAP "String Representation of a Distinguished Name" [1]. Important: the LDAP string format also specifies the order of the attributes in the subject, this is important when issuing certs for LDAP authentication. Example: `CN=foo,DC=corp,DC=example,DC=com` More info [1]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4514 More info: https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/issues/3203 More info: https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/issues/4424 Cannot be set if the `subject` or `commonName` field is set. This is an Alpha Feature and is only enabled with the `--feature-gates=LiteralCertificateSubject=true` option set on both the controller and webhook components.
	LiteralSubject *string `field:"optional" json:"literalSubject" yaml:"literalSubject"`
	// x.509 certificate NameConstraint extension which MUST NOT be used in a non-CA certificate. More Info: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.10 This is an Alpha Feature and is only enabled with the `--feature-gates=NameConstraints=true` option set on both the controller and webhook components.
	NameConstraints *CertificateSpecNameConstraints `field:"optional" json:"nameConstraints" yaml:"nameConstraints"`
	// `otherNames` is an escape hatch for SAN that allows any type.
	//
	// We currently restrict the support to string like otherNames, cf RFC 5280 p 37 Any UTF8 String valued otherName can be passed with by setting the keys oid: x.x.x.x and UTF8Value: somevalue for `otherName`. Most commonly this would be UPN set with oid: 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.3 You should ensure that any OID passed is valid for the UTF8String type as we do not explicitly validate this.
	OtherNames *[]*CertificateSpecOtherNames `field:"optional" json:"otherNames" yaml:"otherNames"`
	// Private key options.
	//
	// These include the key algorithm and size, the used encoding and the rotation policy.
	PrivateKey *CertificateSpecPrivateKey `field:"optional" json:"privateKey" yaml:"privateKey"`
	// How long before the currently issued certificate's expiry cert-manager should renew the certificate.
	//
	// For example, if a certificate is valid for 60 minutes, and `renewBefore=10m`, cert-manager will begin to attempt to renew the certificate 50 minutes after it was issued (i.e. when there are 10 minutes remaining until the certificate is no longer valid).
	// NOTE: The actual lifetime of the issued certificate is used to determine the renewal time. If an issuer returns a certificate with a different lifetime than the one requested, cert-manager will use the lifetime of the issued certificate.
	// If unset, this defaults to 1/3 of the issued certificate's lifetime. Minimum accepted value is 5 minutes. Value must be in units accepted by Go time.ParseDuration https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration.
	RenewBefore *string `field:"optional" json:"renewBefore" yaml:"renewBefore"`
	// The maximum number of CertificateRequest revisions that are maintained in the Certificate's history.
	//
	// Each revision represents a single `CertificateRequest` created by this Certificate, either when it was created, renewed, or Spec was changed. Revisions will be removed by oldest first if the number of revisions exceeds this number.
	// If set, revisionHistoryLimit must be a value of `1` or greater. If unset (`nil`), revisions will not be garbage collected. Default value is `nil`.
	RevisionHistoryLimit *float64 `field:"optional" json:"revisionHistoryLimit" yaml:"revisionHistoryLimit"`
	// Defines annotations and labels to be copied to the Certificate's Secret.
	//
	// Labels and annotations on the Secret will be changed as they appear on the SecretTemplate when added or removed. SecretTemplate annotations are added in conjunction with, and cannot overwrite, the base set of annotations cert-manager sets on the Certificate's Secret.
	SecretTemplate *CertificateSpecSecretTemplate `field:"optional" json:"secretTemplate" yaml:"secretTemplate"`
	// Requested set of X509 certificate subject attributes.
	//
	// More info: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.6
	// The common name attribute is specified separately in the `commonName` field. Cannot be set if the `literalSubject` field is set.
	Subject *CertificateSpecSubject `field:"optional" json:"subject" yaml:"subject"`
	// Requested URI subject alternative names.
	Uris *[]*string `field:"optional" json:"uris" yaml:"uris"`
	// Requested key usages and extended key usages.
	//
	// These usages are used to set the `usages` field on the created CertificateRequest resources. If `encodeUsagesInRequest` is unset or set to `true`, the usages will additionally be encoded in the `request` field which contains the CSR blob.
	// If unset, defaults to `digital signature` and `key encipherment`.
	Usages *[]CertificateSpecUsages `field:"optional" json:"usages" yaml:"usages"`
